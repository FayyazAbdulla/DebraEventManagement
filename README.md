# DebraEventManagement
DebraEventManagement is an event management platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to manage events, track ticket sales, handle partner collaborations, and view metrics. React powers the frontend, while Node.js and MongoDB handle the backend and data storage.
